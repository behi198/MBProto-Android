# MBProto-Android
MBProto is a security protocol designed and developed by BlackShadows Group for client-server end-to-end encryption. Main idea of MBProto is based on Telegramâ€™s encryption protocol (MTProto) and ModBus protocol. Conjunction of these two, makes MBProto suitable for use in client-server end-to-end encryption. 
Also the design of MBProto can be customized to use in P2P architectures. MBProto project started in April 2017, by Mr. Mohammad Ahmadi and Mr. Behrad Ranjbar, and was implemented using C#.Net for server-side by Mohammad Ahmadi, and Android for client-side by Behrad Ranjbar. Later on, In September 2017, MBProto also got Available for IOS Platform by Mr. Hamed Amjadi. 
MBProto is now available for javaScript, and we are working on GoLang Implementation of Server-Side Library, and Kotlin implementation of Android Library. Also this whole implementation is using http request/response, and we are planning to move it on TCP. We are open to any constructive comment on implementation or design of MBProto, and any one who wants to work on this project, or join the team is very welcome.
